# Installation

We recommend using Anaconda from Continuum for the Python distribution and use Conda to manage the Python environment.

1. Check the list of environments that are available and create a Conda environment named govtech if it does not exists already:
    > conda info --envs
    > conda create -y --name=govtech
2. Activate (In Windows, use activate.bat or activate.ps1)and install the Python dependencies:
    > activate govtech
    > conda install --file=requirements.txt
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and access the notebooks and data from this directory via your web browser:
    > jupyter-notebook
